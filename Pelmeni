        "3. Knead the dough on a floured surface until it becomes smooth and elastic.",
        "4. Roll out the dough to about 1/8 inch thickness.",
        "5. Use a round cutter or glass to cut out circles from the dough.",
        "6. Place a small amount of the meat filling in the center of each dough circle.",
        "7. Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape and pinch the edges to seal. Bring the two corners together and pinch to form the traditional pelmeni shape.",
        "8. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.",
        "9. Add the pelmeni to the boiling water and cook until they float to the surface and are fully cooked, about 5-7 minutes.",
        "10. Remove the pelmeni with a slotted spoon and transfer to a serving dish.",
        "11. Serve the pelmeni hot with butter and sour cream.",
        "12. Enjoy your meal!"
